# Solved issues

## For loops

Note : we assume that start <= end : `for (i = start; i <= end; i += step)`

if start > end, then step must be < 0 : `for (i = start; i >= end; i += step)`

Solution 1 : use safe version : `for (i = start; step < 0 ? i >= end : i <= end; i += step)`

**Solution 2** : disallow decreasing variant (but we won't be able to diagnose the issue, simply ignore the problem)

Solution 3 : require *step* to be a compile-time constant so we can choose to either `<=` or `>=` at compile-time instead of at run-time like Solution 1. This would require

- expression evaluation
- constant folding

## What constitutes to be a ParseResult

Rule for what belongs in a parse result:

Don't ParseResult collections, parse result the element type. Having collection properties basically means that we have a variadic node.

No parse result if the node can't exist without it such as when

- the only token parsed is a property (such as Literals)
- allowing a hole will result in too permissive parsing

Two kinds of properties

- Identity properties : the node is the property -> no ParseResult
- Composition properties : the node contains the property -> yes ParseResult

Examples

- Node.Expression.Literal.Integer(string Value) -> no ParseResult
- Node.Type.LengthedString(`ParseResult<Expression> Length`) -> yes ParseResult
