# Notable additions

In order to make Pseudocode usable, a few features that are not present in the taught, "official" flavors of Pseudocode have been added.

These features should probably be avoided in tests.

This document provides an exhaustive list of these "notable additions".

## Type conversions

Sometimes it is necessary to convert values from one type to another. This can be done with a C-like syntax for type casting, or through implicit conversions. [More details](Conversions.md)

## Preprocessor directives

Preprocessor directives (lines starting with `#`) are necessary for configuration (ecrire newlines&hellip;) and provide organizational features like modularity.
