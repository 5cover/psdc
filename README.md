# PSDC (WIP)

IUT de Lannion Pseudocode compiler (transpiler).

## Tools

[VSCode Pseudocode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NoanPerrot.pseudocode)

## Philosophy

Psdc is a transpiler, designed to automate the painstaking task of rewriting Pseudocode programs to other languages.

Given any Pseudocode program (valid or invalid), Psdc produces an equivalent program in the target language to the best of its ability, providing helpful diagnostics along the way.

<q>Equivalent</q> here is defined as:

- **Equivalence in validity**: a valid Pseudocode program transpiles to a valid program in the target language. An invalid program (with compiler errors) may be invalid in the target language.
- **Equivalence in behavior**: a valid Pseudocode program exerts the expected behavior in the target language. Since Pseudocode programs can't be executed, the expected behavior of a program is determined by the Standard (yet to be written).
- **Equivalence in semantics**: a Pseudocode program and its transpiled counterpart must be semantically equivalent. This implies:
  - same identifiers (except where target language keywords are used)
  - same declaration order (as possible considering the rules of the target language)
- **Equivalence in representation**: code generated by Psdc is ready for human reading and modification. It relates the input Pseudocode, making it is easy to see to which part of the input corresponds each part of the output, and vice versa.

### C output configuration

- [ ] Non-null-terminated-string-proof format strings: width specifier for lengthed strings (usually useless since null-terminated, but could be useful if non null-terminated strings are used)
- [ ] Type mappings
  - [ ] `réel` &rarr; `float`, `double`, `long double`?
  - [ ] `entier` &rarr; `short`, `int`, `long`?
  - [ ] `caractère` &rarr; `char`, `tchar_t`, `wchar_t`?
- [ ] Parameter names in prototypes?
- [ ] Doxygen documentation skeleton?
- [ ] `i++` or `++i`
- [ ] Use count-based string functions: strncpy, strncmp...
- [ ] use `puts` instead of `printf` where possible
- [ ] anonymous block in switch cases: always, when multiple statements, never
- [ ] anonymous block in switch default: always, when multiple statements, never
